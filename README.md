# *Space-Warrior*
### A must try Game.
### 4-5 enemy ships will fire on your ship. You will fire to them. You will be having 100 bullets loaded, once they finish some time is required to load the bullets again and there will be a total of 800 bullets.
#### The Game has 2 levels. Level-1 comes with some easy material but real fun resides in level-2.
